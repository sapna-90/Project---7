Disaster tweet classification with NLP.       
This project focuses on leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify tweets as either disaster-related or non-disaster-related.   
Social media platforms like Twitter are vital for disseminating real-time information during emergencies.     
The goal of this project is to develop a robust machine-learning model to address this problem.    
The project workflow is divided into four key phases: data exploration and preparation, feature engineering and model selection, model evaluation, and deployment.     
The dataset comprises 10083 hand-classified tweets, which undergo cleaning to remove noise like URLs, special characters, and punctuation.    
The textual data is then converted into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization, enabling machine learning algorithms to process and analyze the input effectively.     
A logistic regression model was chosen for and its performance was evaluated using metrics like accuracy, classification, ROC-AUC.      
This project demonstrates the potential of NLP in disaster management.
